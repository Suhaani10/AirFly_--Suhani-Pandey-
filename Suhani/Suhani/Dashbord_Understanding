DASHBOARD EXPLANATION:

Aviation Performance Intelligence Dashboard — Detailed Explanation
     This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of flight operations, including flight performance, airline behavior, delays, cancellations, fleet utilization,
     and route patterns. It is designed to quickly reveal operational strengths and weaknesses within the aviation industry.

Top KPI Cards
    At the top, the dashboard displays three important performance indicators:
    Total Flights (2M) – Total number of flights recorded in the dataset.
    On-Time Flights (469K) – Flights that arrived on time, indicating successful and efficient operations.
    Total Delayed Flights (1M) – Flights that arrived late, reflecting performance challenges and customer impact.

Number of Flights by Airline and Aircraft Type
     This stacked bar chart compares the total number of flights operated by each airline while highlighting which aircraft types they predominantly use, such as 
     Airbus A320, Boeing 737, and Boeing 777.
     This helps us understand:
        Which airlines operate the largest fleets.
        Aircraft allocation across airlines.
        Whether an airline is more domestic or international based on aircraft type.

Number of Flights by Origin and Destination
     A Sankey chart visualizes flight flow between major airport hubs. Left blocks represent the origin airports, and right blocks represent the destinations, 
     with connecting lines showing flight frequency.
      Thicker lines indicate busier routes. This helps identify:
      Major hub airports.
      Highest traffic connections.
      Route demand and network strength.

Number of Flights by Hour Bucket
      This bar chart shows how many flights operate during different time windows of the day:
      Morning (most operational activity)
      Afternoon and Evening (steady traffic)
      Night (low traffic)

Number of Flights by Flight Status and Airline
      Another donut chart splits flights into two categories: On-Time and Delayed, and shows this breakdown separately for each airline.
      This helps us determine:
      Which airlines have better punctuality.
      Operational efficiency in managing schedules and turnaround.

Interactive Filters
      Slicers for Origin Airport, Destination Airport, Airline, Aircraft Type, and Diverted status allow a user to dive deeper into the data. 
      These filters make the dashboard dynamic and allow targeted analysis such as:
      Analyzing route performance
      Comparing punctuality across different aircraft
      Checking if flight diversion affects cancellation patterns

Average of DelayMinutes by HourBucket
      This line chart shows the average delay duration across different times of the day:
      Morning (5 AM–12 PM)
      Night (9 PM–5 AM)
      Afternoon (12 PM–5 PM)
      Evening (5 PM–9 PM)
      The line trend helps understand when delays are longest.
      From the displayed pattern:
      Morning has the highest average delay
      Evening shows the lowest average delay

AvgDelay_ByDistanceCategory and Airline
     This stacked bar chart compares average delay time based on:
          Distance Category (Short Haul, Medium Haul, Long Haul)
          Airline
     It explains:
          Whether delays increase with flight distance
          If certain airlines struggle more with delays on specific routes
     For example:
          If long-haul flights show greater delay average → international connectivity issues.
          If one airline’s bars are consistently higher → that airline has performance challenges.

No. of Flight by HourBucket and FlightStatus
     This clustered column chart shows number of flights in each time bucket, separated into:
         On-time flights
         Delayed flights
      It reveals two patterns:
         When more flights are operated
         When more delays occur
     Example from the graph:
         Night and morning hours have more delayed flights
         Evening has the least flight traffic and delays

Cancelled Flights by DistanceCategory and DelayReason
     This donut chart displays flight cancellations split by different distance categories and delay reasons.
     It answers:
         Which distance category is more likely to have cancellations?
        What delay reasons lead to cancellation?
     Sectors shown include:
        Weather delays
        Technical issues
        Security reasons
        Crew/Operational problems
    The chart allows the viewer to:
        Identify most problematic flight types (short/medium/long haul)
        See which reason contributes most to cancellations

At the top of the dashboard, there are several KPI cards:
    Total Flight – Shows the total number of flights analyzed.
    On-Time Flights – Shows how many flights reached their destination within the scheduled time.
    Cancelled Flights – Indicates the number of flights that were cancelled.
    Delayed Flights – Displays how many flights experienced delays.
    Delayed & Cancelled Flights – Shows flights that were both delayed and eventually cancelled (double impact).
